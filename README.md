# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP. The Brazilian e-commerce Dashboard provides insights into online shopping trends, customer behavior, and business performance. It analyzes the total number of orders, payment methods used, and highlights top-selling product categories and best-performing sellers. The dashboard tracks customer reviews, sentiment distribution, and user engagement, helping to identify factors that influence customer satisfaction. Additionally, it explores order trends over time, delivery performance, and regional sales distribution, offering a deeper understanding of e-commerce dynamics in Brazil. The financial aspect is covered by analyzing total revenue, payment trends, and how customer ratings impact sales performance. This data-driven approach helps businesses optimize their strategies, improve customer experience, and make informed decisions in the e-commerce industry.
